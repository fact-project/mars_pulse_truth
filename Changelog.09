   * mbase/MStatusArray.[h,cc]:
     - implemented a special treatment for TGraphs in RecursiveRemove 
       to make sure that the fHistogram pointer doesn't get deleted
       twice.
     - implemented a small fix to make sure an object which is more than
       once in a list of primitives gets really removed.

       bias in the case newer files miss the calibration pattern, but
       that's unavoidable

   * mtrigger/MTriggerPatternDecode.cc:
     - decode trigger pattern for files older than format version 5
       according to the file type
