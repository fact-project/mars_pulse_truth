# This is identical with the later pointing model applied since
# run 85420, which is done with TPoints taken after 18.3.2006 and
# in April 2006. It seems that it is already valid earlier.
# (For unknown reasons the pointing model made from the TPoints
# before 18.3.2006 doesn't seem to give a reasonable pointing model)
