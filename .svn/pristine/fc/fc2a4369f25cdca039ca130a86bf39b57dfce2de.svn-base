     - removed reason2



 2006/08/06 Thomas Bretz

   * datacenter/macros/checkstardone.C,

   * msignal/MArrivalTimePix.h:
     - added some member functions

   * msignal/MExtractTimeAndCharge.cc:
     - added some comments which contain future code

       (FIXME: We need a cut on the number of unsuitable pixels per event)
     - changed handling of sathi to make the detection of hi-gain
       saturation work properly

   * msignal/MExtractTimeAndChargeDigitalFilter.cc:
     - changed fgLoGainOffset from 1.05 to 0.95 (comming out of the
       latest plots)
     - fixed assignment of sat in hi-gain extraction to make sure
       the the satuartion information can be returned properly

     - do not allocate a MTime container anymore. This can be done
       by root automatically which has the advantage that we don't
       have to care about its deletion
     - added some more debug output, just in case...

       speed up the webupdate



 2006/08/02 Thomas Bretz

   * mhist/MHCamEvent.cc:
     - removed some obsolete includes

   * msignal/MExtractTimeAndCharge.cc:
     - reformatted position of a parenthesis

   * msignal/MExtractTimeAndChargeDigitalFilter.cc:
     - changed default lo-gain offset to new value 1.05 which was
       determined plotting arrival time vs. signal height.
     - added fHiGainFirst to time (as it is in the spline extractor)

   * msignal/MSignalCam.cc:
     - after extesive tests using the arrival time vs signal height
       histograms, new threshold levels (independent of the pixel size)
       have been determined for the pulse positions
       (50phe for pulse, hi-gain and 320phe for lo-gain)

   * datacenter/macros/fillsignal.C:
     - changed to support new information about pulse positions



 2006/08/01 Thomas Bretz

       MCalibrationChargeCam if reinitialized

   * mcalib/MCalibrateData.cc:
     - removed obsolete use of zenith angle (which actually was never used)
     - fixed a bug which caused the renorm factor being initialized from
       default instead of the QECam always (which didn't make any difference
       because also the QECam contains the default value)

   * mcalib/MCalibrateRelTimes.[h,cc]:
     - store also the information whether lo-gain was used or not in
       MSignalCam
     - removed some comments from header

   * mcalib/MCalibrationQEPix.[h,cc]:

   * macros/starfield.C:
     - updated to use resources/mirrors.def by default

   * mhist/MHCamera.[h,cc]:
     - replaced SavePrimitive(ofstream&) by SavePrimitive(ostream&)
     - if necessary let SavePrimitive(ofstream&) call 
       SavePrimitive(ostream&)

   * mgui/MHexagon.[h,cc]:
     - special solution for SavePrimitive because it calls a function
       from the base class which also needs ofstream or ostream

   * mbase/MStatusDisplay.[h,cc]:
     - switched on writing bmp and xml (I still found no program able
       to read this bmp, but they are written)
     - removed check for writing images in batch mode for root
       >= 5.12/00. It is working now.
     - calculate kB and MB correctly by dividing by 1000 instead of
       1024 (would be kiB and MiB)
     - removed some unused parameters from function declaration
     - fixed some warnings about local overwrites of variable names
     - fixed a deprecated conversion from string constant to `char*



 2006/07/29 Thomas Bretz

   * mhflux/MHEffectiveOnTime.cc:
     - changed the fit such that initial values are calculated
       automatically now instead of using build in values. This
       makes the fit more indepedant of the underlaying rates.
       With a test of ~350 sequences in the test database it could
       be shown that the new fit gives the same result +/-1sek.
       The highest deviation was +5s the lowest -10s.
     - the number of the first bin used in the fit became a variable
     - A limit of 15kHz was set for the rate
     - sanity checkes for lambda==0 added (possible division by zero)
     - increased class version number by one
     - made functions derived from MH private
     - to fit the resulting "gammas" use fFirstBin=1 and fNumEvents=120
