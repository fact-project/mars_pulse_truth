   * manalysis/MExtractedSignalPix.cc
     - in Clear(), initialized fExtractedSignalHiGain to 0 instead 
       of -1. In MC files run without noise, the ADC info of pixels 
       with no C-photons is missing. Later noise will be added to all 
       pixels in the padding, and "empty" ones must have a 0 before 
       the addition of this noise.

   * manalysis/MGeomApply.cc
     - initialized size of MPedPhotCam.

   * manalysis/MMcCalibrationCalc.[cc,h]
     - Removed setter function SetConversionHiLo: the ratio from high 
       to low gain is now read from MMcFadcHeader, and set in ReInit.
     - Fixed bug: fADC2PhOuter was initialized before the MMcFadcHeader
       was available. Now it is done in ReInit.
     - fPedPhotCam is now initialized in PreProcess and not in ReInit.
     - fGeom is now set in ReInit (there should be one MGeomCam per
       run header in the camera file).

   * mmc/MMcFadcHeader.hxx
     - added getter function GetLow2HighGain()

     - Treatment of the conversion factors between HI Gain and Lo Gain
       is now done in the MCalibrationPix. 

       MExtractSignal does not convert anymore, but MCalibrate searches

       setting pixel pixid to unused, in case !pix.IsValid()
       May be removing both commands (adding the pixel and setting it 
       to unused would have the same effect).

       multi-telescope MC camera file, where master branches for each
       telescope are tagged with ;i  being i  the number of telescope.

       earth's surface. Tables are from Adrian Biland. A method is
       included which allows treating gammas as electrons (i.e. rejects
       low energy particles).

 2003/11/05: Marcos Lopez
  
   * mmontecarlo/MMcWeightEnergySpecCalc.[h,cc]
     - Now, if the new spectrum for the MC showers is a power law, we
       don't convert it to a TF1 function.
     - Changed the constructor for the case in which the new spectrum
       is passed as a TF1 function. Now we pass the TF1 object by
       reference.
     - Thanks to the suggestions of T. Bretz, added three more
       constructors to give the possibility of passing the shape of the
       new spectrum in other different ways. Now, if the new spectrum
       that you want for the MC showers is different from a power law,
       you can specify its shape either with a TF1 function, with a
       string (char*), or with a general C++ function defined by your
       own. 
     - In function Reinit(): added a sanity check to prevent from
       dividing by zero.
     - In PreProcess(): removed an unnecessary sentence.
     - Fixed a compiling error which appeared under gcc 3.3

     - Fixed thread safety of UpdateTab()
     - Fixed some crashes in case fTab==NULL
     - Tried to make HandleConfigureNotify more flexible to allow
       the new fUserFrame to work correctly - needs still some
       investigations

     - adapted to changes in MTime

   * mgeom/MGeomCam.[h,cc]:
     - precalculate pix ratio (and square root of it) for faster
       calculations. This makes sense, because these values are
       needed at least n times (while n is the number of pixels)
       per event. Which results in billions of calculations already
       for some events.
     - implemented CalcPixRatio to do the precalculation

     - changed a C-cast to a C++-cast
     
   * mfileio/MWriteRootFile.h:
     - changed BIT(16) to BIT(17). UPDATE mode was not working
       with newer root versions, because BIT(16) was used already
       
   * manalysis/MBlindPixelCalc.cc, manalysis/MCerPhotCalc.cc,
     manalysis/MGeomApply.cc, manalysis/MMcPedestalCopy.cc,

     - added double-cast to TProgressBar::SetPosition
       
   * mbase/MTask.h:

     - removed TROOT-object
     - readraw.cc: added more functionality

   * mraw/MRawEvtData.cc:
     - changed positions of 'fush' in Print() (this confused 'more'
       because 'more' also counts the ANSI color codes to determin
       the line-length)

   * mhistmc/MHMcCollectionArea.cc:
     - added UseCurrentStyle such that the axis labels are displayed

   * mbase/MTime.[h,cc]:

     - adapted to changes in MTime
     - minor change to output in Print()



 2003/10/31: Marcos Lopez

   * mhist/MFillH.cc:
     - Fixed a bug in function PreProcess(MParList *pList). Inside the 
       conditional sentence "if (!fWeight && !fWeightName.IsNull())",  
       fWeight never pointed to the object MWeight recoverd from the 
       parameter list.

   * mhistmc/MHMcEnergyImpact.cc:
     - In the Fill function, pass the weight to the histogram fHist.

   * mmontecarlo/MMcWeightEnergySpecCalc.[h,cc]:

 2003/10/31: Thomas Bretz

   * mars.cc:
     - change TGApllication back to TApplication (TGApplication doesn't
       load the TVirtualPad plugin by default) DISPLAY must be set
       manually if it is not set.



 2003/10/30: Antonio Stamerra

   * manalysis/MMcTriggerLvl2.[h,cc]
     - Added method CalcTriggerPattern to check which x-NN compact
       pattern the event satisfies. The variable member fTriggerPattern 
       contains the number x (x=3,4,5,6,7). 
     - Inline function GetTriggerPattern added.

   * manalysis/MMcTriggerLvl2Calc.cc
     - Added call to the MMcTriggerLvl2::CalcTriggerPattern in Process().



 2003/10/30: Thomas Bretz

   * manalysis/MCerPhotEvt.[h,cc]:
     - fixed a bug in the new Lut-stuff. Sometimes pixels where
       considered existing, because there where no mark for 
       empty entries in the Lut.
     - all loops ignored pixel with index 0 and used it as reference
       pixel - this is wrong, because pixel 0 must not exist at all.
       Now all loops are starting with pixel 0.

   * mimage/MImgCleanStd.[h,cc]:
     - renamed various local variables from 'id' to 'idx'
     - in clean step 4 we assumed that a pixel with idx2 is existing
       - this is a dangerous assumption. It is checked now.



 2003/10/29: Thomas Bretz
  
   * manalysis/AnalysisLinkDef.h, manalysis/Makefile:
     - removed MMcPedestalRead

       the file type for each file again.
     - added const-qualifiers in the class header
       
   * manalysis/MMcPedestalNSBAdd.[h,cc]:
     - don't do something if camera file version is < 0.7
     - do not remove itself from the tasklist, but check 
       the file type for each file again.
     - added const-qualifiers in the class header
     
   * mgui/MCamEvent.cc:
     - added a comment
     
   * mimage/MHillasCalc.[h,cc]:
     - replaced the fixed size array fErrors by a dynamic size array
       (TArrayC) to make sure, that people get a warning on the
       screen if the reprogram the error handling and write
       into an unallowed index.

   * macros/readCT1.C:
     - fixed to work with the correct geometry
     
   * macros/readMagic.C:
     - fixed - was crashing
     
   * macros/tar.C:
     - exclude 'Tag' files from tar
     
   * manalysis/MGeomApply.[h,cc]:
     - replaced constructor by SetGeometry (constructor was
       not unique)

   * mbase/MEvtLoop.[h,cc]:
     - set fProgress already when setting fDisplay (gives the
       possibility to overwrite fProgress)
     - removed 'entries' from ProcessGuiEvents (moved to fNumEvents)
     - Set ProgressBar position in percent instead of event number
     - Set progress bar range from 0 to 1
     
   * mbase/MReadSocket.cc:
     - fixed to treat timeout correctly
     - replaces usleep() by gSystem->Sleep()

   * mbase/MTime.h:
     - added SetTime(ULong_t) (support for gSystem->Now())
     - added SetTime(Double_t)
     - added operator()
     - fixed all comparison operators to use time instead of
       time lo/hi - will be removed soon
       
   * mimage/MHHillasSrc.cc:
     - delete 3rd Pad
     
   * mraw/MRawEvtData.cc:
     - when drawing print gPad



 2003/10/28: Wolfgang Wittek

   * manalysis/MCT1PadONOFF.cc
     - replace GetMeanRms() by GetPedestalRms()
     - replace SetMeanRms() by SetPedestalRms()
     - reactivate code which was commented out by tgb
       (no compilation errors on Alpha OSF)

   * manalysis/AnalysisLinkDef.h, manalysis/Makefile
     - put back MCT1PadONOFF

   * macros/CT1Analysis.C, macros/ONOFFCT1Analysis.C
     - current versions of macros for the analysis of CT1 data



 2003/10/26: Oscar Blanch Bigas

   * mmc/MMcFadcHeader.[cc,h]
     - Added variable member that has the sigma of the electronic noise
       that goes with the same value to both FADC gains (fDigitalNoise)
     - Class version has been changed from 2 to 3.



 2003/10/24: Abelardo Moralejo

   * manalysis/MMcPedestalRead.[cc,h]
     - Added. In coming camera version (0.7) the pedestal sigma per 
       FADC slice is calculated by the camera simulation at run time, 
       then written to the output file. This class reads in the pedestal
       mean and sigma to be later used in the analysis (for tail cuts 
       mainly). This task will replace MMcPedestalCopy and 
       MMcPedestalNSBAdd for camera >= 0.7 files, for which the second
       class would produce wrong results.



 2003/10/23: Abelardo Moralejo

   * mhistmc/MHMcEnergyMigration.cc
     - Changed the Draw procedure: with new root versions (3.04, 3.05)
       the result of the used drawing options was different from what 
       we had in 3.02, and the graphics output had become unreadable. 
       Replacing some Draw() calls by DrawCopy() has solved the problem.



 2003/10/23: Thomas Bretz

   * macros/star.C:
     - replaced geometry by the task MGeomApply

   * manalysis/MCerPhotCalc.cc:

     - reset Batch mode in any case
     
   * meventdisp/MGCamDisplay.cc:
     - use new MHCamera::SetLevels to display cleaning levels
     
   * mhist/MHCamera.[h,cc]:
     - removed FillLevels - obsolete
     - added SetLevels instead


 2003/10/21: Wolfgang Wittek

     - changed GetPedestalRms to GetElecNoise to make Mars compile with
       the changes done in MMcFadcHeader

   * mmc/MMcTrig.cxx:
     - changed <iostream.h> to <iostream> according to C++

   * mhistmc/MHMcTriggerLvl2.[h,cc]:
     - MHMcTriggerLvl2::GetHistByName removed const-qualifier and 
       changed return type to TH1 according to definition in MH.

   * macros/status.C:
     - use MDirIter instead of a single file name
     - adde MHTriggerLvl0
     - Simplified macro by using PrintOutliers

   * mhist/MHCamEvent.[h,cc]:
     - renamed PrintOutlayers to PrintOutliers
     - Divide pad only into two subpads

   * mfilter/MF.cc:
     - added comment about '=='

   * mhist/MHMatrix.cc:
     - removed some pieces of code which preserved the contents
       of a matrix when resizing. This is done by root now.

   * mfilter/MFRealTimePeriod.[h,cc]:
     - added

   * mfilter/Makefile, mfilter/FilterLinkDef.h:
     - added MFRealTimePeriod

     - added Profile-option (display contents/entries)
     - added Freeze-option  (ignore filling data into the histogram)
     - added UseCurrentStyle to get the y-axis back
     - overwrite DrawCopy

   * manalysis/MCerPhotEvt.[h,cc]:
     - added fLut to accelerate searching an index a lot, this should
       be backward compatible to old class versions
     - increased class version to 2
     - removed all searches for indices - replaced by GetPixById
     - GetPixById no uses the look-up-table, which is much much faster
       and still searches the array if the fLut size is 0 which might
       be because of a class version 1 object is read from a file -
       according to Rene this should work.

   * manalysis/MPedestalCam.[h,cc]:
     - replaced a C-cast by a C++ static_cast

   * mhist/MH.[h,cc]:
     - renamed them from Draw/DrawCopy to DrawSame/DrawSameCopy

   * mraw/MRawEvtData.[h,cc]:

     - overwrote Copy() member function

   * mhist/MFillH.[h,cc]:
     - added GetCanvas()

     mimage/MHNewImagePar.cc:
     - changed Draw to DrawSame

   * mhist/MHCamEvent.cc:
     - use new MHCamera profile mode

   * mbase/MEvtLoop.cc, mmain/MStatusDisplay.cc:
     - check whether application is TRint to make mone thread safe
       This is necessary not to call ProcessEvents() twice at the
       same time!



 2003/10/17: Oscar Blanch

       of fLutPseudoSize vs. energy and of fSizeBiggerCell vs. energy
     - modified method MHMcTriggerLvl2::GetHistByName which now

 2003/09/24: Abelardo Moralejo

   * macros/MagicHillas.C, star.C
     - Added const qualifier to TArrayF w(15,x); I got a crash due to
       this missing qualifier when changing some code in MCerPhotCalc
       (not yet submitted).

   * macros/CT1Hillas.C
     - removed code containing TArrayF w(15,x) (which was commented)
       since it made no sense for CT1.

   * mhist/MHFindSignificance.cc
     - add fHist->UseCurrentStyle()
       to get the y-axis + labels drawn

         values of the parameters
         'params' and 'steps' are the initial values in case parSCinit == ""
     - add member functions GetMatrixTrain() and GetMatrixTest()

       because it didn't work; now the matrices are written out in
       DefineTrainMatrix(), DefineTestMatri() and DefineTrainTestMatrix()

   * macros/CT1EgyEst.C
     - don't use Daniel's energy estimator

   * mmontecarlo/MMcEnergyEst.cc
     - extend printout of comments



 2003/09/17: Abelardo Moralejo

   * manalysis MCerPhotCalc.cc:
     - in warning about saturating low gains in pixels: changed the 
       'if' by a 'switch' and slightly corrected text of warning (no 
       change in performance or results).



 2003/09/16: Abelardo Moralejo

   * manalysis MCerPhotCalc.[h,cc]:
     - added the low gain treatment. It has first been implemented by
       TB, and the version I submit is a slightly modified one. If any 
       high gain FADC slice is saturated, we switch to low gain. If low 
       gain is also saturated, the signal is nevertheless calculated 
       ("truncated" of course), and a warning is displayed reporting 
       the number of saturated pixels in the current event. 
       Fixed also the calculation of the mean pixel pedestal (added 
       variable fSumWeights), which previously would not work correctly 
       in the case that one sets weights different from 0 or 1 in the 
       array fWeight (which was anyway not done up to now, as far as I 
       know). It would be necessary to add to the parameters of the 
       analyzed events the number of saturated pixels in some way. 
       In the MC files produced with camera versions 0.6 or earlier, no
       low gain is simulated, and saturation of high gain is not 
       correctly implemented, so this should not introduce any change
       in the analysis of present or old MC files.



 2003/09/12: Thomas Bretz
 
   * mimage/MHillasSrc.cc:
     - fixed the NaN-problem in the calculation of Alpha. More 
       information can be found in the comments there.

   * mhist/MHFadcCam.[h,cc]:
     - skip MC events which have no FADC information stored
     - better output in case of changes in the number of slices
     - added size argument to constructor to support ECO100, too.
     - removed all fixed numbers and replaced them by the corresponding
       function
     - fixed pixel numbering to be consistent with the software pixel
       numbering in the rest of Mars

   * mhist/MHFadcPix.[h,cc]:
     - fixed the missing y-axis (UseCurrentStyle()) 
     - fixed pixel numbering by changing default arument of pixid in
       constructor from 0 to -1

   * mmain/MDataCheck.cc
     - added 'Time Spectra of Cosmics' button
     - added size argument to instatiation of MHFadcCam



 2003/09/10: Thomas Bretz
 
   * mdata/MDataChain.[h,cc]:
     - added log2, acosh, asinh, atanh, ceil, isnan and finite
     - changed math.h callings to TMath:: namespace to be more
       consistent
       
   * mhist/MHMatrix.[h,cc]:
     - added RemoveInvalidRows member function to get rid of rows
       containing invalid numbers (nan, inf)

   * mraw/MRawEvtHeader.cc:
     - fixed variable types calculating the time (ns, s, m and h)
       to get rid of some compiler warnings, casting the values 
       for-, back- and forward only wasts computing time.



 2003/09/08: Abelardo Moralejo

   * mhist/MHOnSubtraction.cc: 
     - added some casts in the arguments of function calls, to get rid 
       of compilation warnings due to mismatch of variable type 
       (variables: lowerBin, upperBin). Corrected order of arguments in 
       TH1D constructor of fSignificanceHist (number of bins and bin 
       limits).

   * mraw/MRawEvtHeader.cc:
     - Added casts to arguments of fTime->SetTime(h, m, s, ns) to get 
       rid of compilation warnings.

   * mhist/MHCamera.cc:
     - Changed calls to abs and fabs by TMath::Abs. At least in RH7.2 
       with gcc2.96, abs() was not recognized.



 2003/09/07: Abelardo Moralejo

   * manalysis/MCerPhotCalc.cc:
     - removed normalization of array fWeight introduced on 30/06. For
       now, this array is intended only to select the FADC slices which
       we want to integrate to get the signal. The use of this feature
       of MCerPhotCalc is explained in the example macro MagicHillas.C
       The array fWeight must contain 0's and 1's. If we normalize
       these values, the signal units is no longer ADC counts (but 
       "average ADC counts per slice"). As David realized, this was the 
       reason for the discrepancies in the gamma/hadron separation 
       results we were observing lately. The meaning of Size was 
       different among the different people working on the subject, and 
       hence, when we compared samples with a given Size cut we were
       actually comparing different energy ranges.

     - Turned fSumQuadWeights to its original meaning, the quadratic 
       sum (square root of the sum of the squares) of the values in the 
       fWeight array. Why was this changed?? (sqrt removed) Only because 
       of the name of the variable??

     - Changed the calculation of the mean pedestal to fit the meaning
       of fSumQuadWeights.

     - Moved the call to ScalePedestals() to the end of the ReInit 
       function. Formerly it was called before the setting of the 
       variable fEnableFix, and then the mean pedestal in each FADC 
       slice was wrong by 0.5 units... once more: please Thomas B, 
       be careful with these kind of changes.

       events of one type, then those of the other) the method does not

   * mmontecarlo/MMcCollectionareaCalc.[h,cc]
     - Now the energy limits and spectral slope used in Corsika are
       read from the run header. Warning: impact parameter is still
       fixed (I changed it from 400 m to 300 m, our present MC 
       production default). Added warning message about this. 
       Collection areas calculated up to now with the new MC library 
       are overestimated by a ~77% ! This class will be removed in 
       the future and replaced by MFillH.

   * mmontecarlo/MMcTriggerRateCalc.cc
     - The check of the MC spectral index value is now done by 
       comparing integers instead of real numbers.
     - Found out with GREAT surprise that the graphical output
       has been completely commented out by someone(?) because it 
       produced a memory leak. Also the function comment did not 
       match the rules (my fault; is it correct now?) This commenting 
       out has not been logged to this file, as far as I can see. This
       is rather unkind, I thought that when somebody finds some bug or
       messy code, he should either correct and commit it (and log the 
       change here) and/or inform the author of the mistake to correct 
       it. Please try to do so in the future instead of simply 
       commenting out useful code!

        plotting in the simple way some variables in a tree
        (example: fConc and others in the output  of star.C). This
        is a temporal fix, I guess something will have to
