# ------------------------------------------------------------
# General information
#
# This are the most important settings. For more details of
# more resources please have a look at the class reference 
# of MCalendar and the descriptions of its member functions.

# For something in the box for each day (defined in "Contents")
# you have several options which are always known (as an example
# "Day" is used here):
#
#  - Day.TextAlign: Center
#    Defines the position of the output in the box. For more 
#    details about what is allowed see MEnv::GetAlign
#
#  - Day.Format: %e
#    available if a number (month, week, day, etc) should be
#    formatted (or converted into text) For more details on
#    the allowed formats see MTime::GetFormatStr or strftime
#
#  - Day.TextColor: Blue
#    Defined the output color. For more details see
#    MEnv::GetColor
#
#  - Day.TextFont: 62
#    Define the font for the output text. For more details
#    see TAttText
#
#  - To change the settings depending on the day of the week
#    (0=sonday, 1=monday, etc) put the number of the day
#    behind the Name of your resource, eg. To diaply the day-number
#    of sundays in red (while all others are black) use
#       Day.TextColor: Black
#       Day.Active.0.TextColor: Red
#    The term Active before the 0 defines that only the active
#    days are printed in red. Active days are the days which belong 
#    to the current month (sometimes before the beginning or end
#    of a month the days of the previous or next month are shown,
#    the are called Inactive) To change the color of the inactive
#    sundays to red do
#       Day.Inactive.0.TextColor: Red
#    You can also change the text font to green for all active
#    days (except the sunday which is already set to red):
#       Day.Active.TextColor: red
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Which contents should the calendar have? Here you define what
# should be displayed in your box. You could also name them
# A and B instead of Day and Date. The result would be identical 
# (I mean the name is totally artificial and defined here)
# This also means that you can define as many of them as you want.
# In this example files (calendar.rc and holidays.rc) the
# following possible options are defined (see below):
#   Day Date Holiday Birthday DayName Week
Contents: Day Date Holiday Birthday DayName
