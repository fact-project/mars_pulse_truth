# This script is removing lock files which are older than 12 hours. 
# 
# Each process in the automatic analysis is writing a lock file. As these 
# processes are launched with condor, they are stopped after 12 hours, if 
# they are still running. In this case the lock files are not removed. 
# 
# By comparing the date of the lock file and the current date, the 
# running time of a process is determined and if it is bigger than 12 
# hours (which means that the process has been already kill by condor) the 
# lock file is removed
